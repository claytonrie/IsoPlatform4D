# Box 3
A couple months ago, I prototyped 3 different 'box' games as practice and proof-of-concept for some ideas for platforming games.
The first, second, and third were 2D, 3D, and 4D, respectively. However I ran into trouble with writing a custom 3D rendering
engine for

This revists the idea I had in my third prototype, an open-world isometric 4D platforming game. 
It is written with Javascript, three.js, and WebGL.

Outside of some basic platforming mechanics, like jumping, momentum, wall-jumping, and controlled jumping, 
the player has the ability to navigate a 4-dimensional space by switching which 3 dimensions they see at any one point in time.

### Maths
In the future, I will add a file named "maths.pdf" that describes how the maths of the 4D-to-3D projections work.
